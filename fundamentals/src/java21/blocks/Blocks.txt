Instance Block:
Instance block is similar to method which has no name, it can be written inside a class only but not inside a method.
It always executed before the constructor.
We can use variable only inside the instance block not method.
We write time consuming code inside an instance block like - JDBC connectivity.

Static Block:
It is such kind of block in java which gets executed at the time of loading the .class file into JVM memory.

Local Block:
It is a group of statements enclosed within curly braces {} that can appear inside a method, constructor, or initializer.
It is mainly used to limit the scope of variables to that specific block â€” once the block ends, those variables are destroyed.
