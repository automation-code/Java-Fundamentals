Looping Statement
For loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use for loop.

While loop is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly until the specified Boolean condition is true.

Do-While loop is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly, until the specified condition is true.
If the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once, it is recommended to use a do-while loop.
