Types of Implementation for Abstraction
Abstract Class
Interface

Abstract Class - A class which contains the abstract keyword in its declaration is called abstract class.
We can't create object for abstract class.
It may or may not contain methods.
It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
To use an abstract class you have to inherit it from sub class.
If a class contain partial implementation then we should declare a class as abstract.

Abstract Method - A method which contain abstract modifier at the time of declaration is called abstract method.
It can only be used in abstract class.
It doesn’t contain only body {} and always ends with ";"
Abstract method must be overridden in sub-classes otherwise it will also become an abstract class.
Whenever the action is common but implementation are different then we should use abstract method.
