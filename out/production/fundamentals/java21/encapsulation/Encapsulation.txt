Encapsulation:
Binding code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation.
Class variables/attributes should be as a private.
Class method should be as a public.
Provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable.
Private variables can only be accessed within the same class.
The get method returns the variable value, and the set method sets the value.
