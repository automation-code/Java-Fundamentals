StringBuilder to demonstrate its mutability and efficiency
StringBuilder is mutable, meaning it can be changed after it is created
StringBuilder is not synchronized, meaning it is not thread-safe
StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer and String when concatenating strings in a loop

StringBuffer is mutable, meaning it can be changed after it is created
StringBuffer is synchronized, meaning it is thread-safe
