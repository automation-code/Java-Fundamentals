Primitive Data Types: Include byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean. They store simple values and have a fixed size.
Non-Primitive Data Types: Include classes, interfaces, and arrays. They can store complex data and have methods associated with them.
Type Casting: The process of converting a variable from one data type to another. It can be implicit (automatic) or explicit (manual).
