Inheritance - When we construct a new class from existing class in such a way that the new class access all the features
and properties of existing class called inheritance.

In java extends keyword is used to perform inheritance.
It provides code reusability.
We can't access private members of class through inheritance.
A sub class contains all the features of super class so, we should create the object of sub class.
Method overriding only possible through inheritance.

Types of Inheritance
Simple Inheritance - It contains only one super class and only one sub class is called simple inheritance.
Multiple Inheritance - When multiple sub classes access from one super class then called multiple inheritance.
